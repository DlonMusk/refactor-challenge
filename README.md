**DESCRIPTION**
in this challenge we had to refactor a code base that was provided to us to simulate a ticket a junior developer would recieve. The refactoring included re-naming div tags, cleaning up HTML structure, adding and changing element classes and ID's, re-organizing CSS, adding comments to the code and ensuring no visual changes to the website.
